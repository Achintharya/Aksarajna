BCD ON PARTS OF OPEN CELLS EXEMPTED TO PROMOTE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING

TO BOOST BATTERY PRODUCTION, ADDITIONAL CAPITAL GOODS FOR EV AND MOBILE BATTERY MANUFACTURING EXEMPTED

To support Domestic Manufacturing and Value Addition, BCD on 25 critical minerals, that were not domestically available, were exempted in July 2024. The Budget 2025-26 fully exempts cobalt powder and waste, scrap of lithium-ion battery, Lead, Zinc and 12 more critical minerals.

35 additional capital goods for EV battery manufacturing, and 28 additional capital
goods for mobile phone battery manufacturing exempted.

This move is a significant step towards making electric vehicles more affordable and aligns with the governmentâ€™s goal of achieving 30 per cent of automobile sales as EVs by 2030, accelerating progress towards a more sustainable future.
