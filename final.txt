In the spirit of promoting domestic manufacturing and value addition, the Budget 2025-26 has made substantial strides bolstering electric vehicle (EV) and battery manufacturing. 
The government has fully exempted cobalt powder and waste, scrap of lithium-ion battery, Lead, Zinc, and 12 other critical minerals from Basic Custom Duty (BCD). 
This move is a strategic step towards making electric vehicles more affordable, aligning with the government's ambitious goal of achieving 30% of automobile sales as EVs by 2030. 
Furthermore, the budget has exempted 35 additional capital goods for EV battery manufacturing and 28 additional capital goods for mobile phone battery manufacturing. 
These exemptions are expected to boost battery production, thereby reducing dependence on imported components and making the EV industry more self-sufficient. 
This is a significant leap towards accelerating progress towards a more sustainable future, where electric vehicles become a norm rather than an exception. 
The exempted minerals and capital goods are expected to stimulate domestic manufacturing, creating job opportunities and fostering innovation in the EV sector.
