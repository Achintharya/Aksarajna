 The budget 2025-26 has made a significant stride in promoting domestic manufacturing by exempting additional capital goods for EV and mobile battery manufacturing. This move aligns with the government's goal of achieving 30% of automobile sales as EVs by 2030, accelerating progress towards a more sustainable future.

To support domestic value addition, the budget has fully exempted cobalt powder and waste, scrap of lithium-ion battery, Lead, Zinc, and 12 other critical minerals in July 2024. This move is expected to boost battery production and make electric vehicles more affordable for consumers.

With the exempted capital goods, companies can now manufacture batteries locally, reducing dependence on imported goods. This will not only create job opportunities but also contribute to India's growth by making EVs more accessible and promoting cleaner energy use with renewable energy integration.
