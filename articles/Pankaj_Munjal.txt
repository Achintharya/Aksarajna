In the dynamic world of Indian business, one name that stands out prominently is that of Pankaj M Munjal. Born on December 15, 1962, in Ludhiana, Punjab, Munjal is an influential businessman who has left an indelible mark on India's bicycle and automobile industries.

After completing his early schooling at The Lawrence School, Sanawar, and graduating with a Science degree, Munjal ventured into the family business. He received training in Automotive Manufacturing from Kettering University in the USA and attended executive programs in Strategic Marketing Management at both the London Business School and Harvard University.

In 1988, he established Hero Motors Ltd., a pioneer in the automotive moped segment with its brand Hero Puch. He joined his father's company, Hero Cycles Limited, in 1988, becoming Co-chairman and managing director in 2011, and taking over executive responsibilities in 2010.

Munjal took over the company from his father, Om Prakash Munjal, in 2015, and has been a non-executive director at Munjal Showa Limited since May 16, 1985. His leadership has seen Hero Cycles Limited emerge as one of India's largest bicycle manufacturers based in Punjab.

His son, Aditya Munjal, is the CEO of Hero Lectro, the market leader in the e-cycle category in India. Pankaj M Munjal is also ranked among the most popular businesspersons and is listed among the famous people born in India.

In the Budget 2025-26, the government exempted additional capital goods for EV and mobile phone battery manufacturing to boost battery production and support domestic manufacturing. This move aligns with Munjal's vision of making electric vehicles more affordable and contributing to India's goal of achieving energy independence and reducing its carbon footprint.

While his net worth is estimated to be $5 Million as of December 11, 2023, the source of his income primarily comes from his business ventures in the cycles and motor industry.
