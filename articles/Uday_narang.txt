 **Title: Omega Seiki Mobility's Journey Towards Electrifying Asia**

In the dynamic world of electric mobility, one name stands out, Omega Seiki Mobility (OSM). Founded by Uday Narang in 2018, OSM is an innovative force revolutionizing the cargo vehicle industry across Asia. Born in New Delhi and holding an MBA in Finance from Stonybrook University, New York, Narang gained acclaim in the commodity and energy trading industry before making waves as one of the world's most innovative fund managers during the deregulation era of the US markets.

With a vision to create a Pan-Asian brand, OSM is expanding beyond cargo vehicles into the B2B business for two-wheelers and medium and heavy commercial vehicles. The company's philosophy is grounded in innovation, design, and safety, aiming to be a globally top player in the commercial electric vehicle segment by 2025.

OSM's mission is multifaceted, encompassing continuous technological and service development while fostering a sustainable talent and partner ecosystem. The company's leadership includes industry veterans such as Richard Gerstenberg (CEO of OSM Europe), Neeraj Kumar Budhiraja (CFO of OSM), Nida Khanam (CHRO of OSM), Manuj Malhotra (Vice President of Supply Chain at OSM), Kushal Muchhal (Vice President of Strategy and M&A at OSM), Rakesh Ranjan (Head of Retail Finance at OSM), Gary Donald Neal (Vice President of Operational Excellence at OSM), and more.

OSM's product portfolio includes a variety of electric vehicles, such as three-wheelers (Rage+ Qik, Rage+, Rage+ Frost, Rage+ ATR, and Tipper), two-wheelers (Mopido), and four-wheelers (M1KA and M1KA 1.0). Additionally, the company offers services like UNO Express and SooryaUday.

The Budget 2025-26 in India aims to boost battery production and support domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles by exempting additional capital goods for EV and mobile phone battery manufacturing. This move aligns with OSM's mission, contributing to the country's goal of achieving energy independence and reducing its carbon footprint.

As we move towards a sustainable future, Omega Seiki Mobility is leading the charge in electrifying Asia. With its innovative approach, strong leadership, and commitment to quality, the company is poised to make significant strides in the electric mobility sector.
