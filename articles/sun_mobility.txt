 Title: SUN Mobility: Revolutionizing Electric Vehicle Battery Swapping in India

In the rapidly evolving landscape of electric vehicles (EVs), one company stands out for its innovative approach to battery swapping technology - SUN Mobility. Founded in 2017 as a joint venture between the SUN Group and the Maini Group, SUN Mobility has been at the forefront of developing, manufacturing, and operating battery swapping infrastructure for electric two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and larger commercial vehicles.

Key to SUN Mobility's success is its Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS) and Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) solutions. By separating the battery from the vehicle, they offer a 'pay-as-you-go' model for electric vehicles, making EV adoption more accessible and affordable. Their modular Smart Batteries are smaller, lighter, and swappable in just a few minutes, reducing downtime significantly.

The company's innovative technologies extend beyond smart batteries to include quick interchange stations, smart networks, and plug-and-play docks. SUN Mobility has partnered with fleet operators such as Amazon, Zomato, and Swiggy, shared mobility service providers, and automotive OEMs like Omega Seiki Mobility, Hero Electric, Piaggio Vehicles Pvt. Ltd., and others. They have also collaborated with energy infrastructure players, electricity distribution companies, and city transport corporations.

Recognition for SUN Mobility's innovative efforts has been pouring in. In 2019, Bosch invested $25 million in the company, followed by a $50 million investment from Vitol in 2021. The company has received several awards and recognitions, including the prestigious "Championship of Disruptive Innovation" award by the Global IP Convention (GIPC) Awards.

SUN Mobility currently operates over 630 active swap stations across India, covering approximately 30 million emission-free kilometers monthly, and saving around 56,000 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions so far. With a network expanding rapidly to reduce downtime and unlock new possibilities for EV adoption at scale, SUN Mobility is poised to revolutionize the electric vehicle landscape in India.

Based in Bangalore, Karnataka, SUN Mobility is privately held and employees around 501-1,000 people. Led by Managing Director and CEO Ajay Goel, the company's independent director is Karthee Madasamy, ex-MD of Qualcomm Ventures. Dharmendra Pundeer heads software delivery and operations, while Subhash Bhat serves as CFO.

As the government continues to support domestic manufacturing and value addition in electric vehicle and battery production, SUN Mobility is well-positioned to lead the charge towards a greener and more sustainable future for India.
