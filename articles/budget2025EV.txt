 The Budget 2025 has brought significant relief to the electric vehicle (EV) industry in India. In line with the government's goal of achieving 30 per cent of automobile sales as EVs by 2030, several measures have been announced to boost battery production and promote domestic manufacturing.

To start with, 25 critical minerals, which were not domestically available in India, are now exempted from basic customs duty (BCD). This exemption will support the growth of EV battery manufacturing in the country, creating job opportunities and enhancing the domestic manufacturing ecosystem. Additionally, 35 additional capital goods for EV battery manufacturing have been exempted, further boosting the sector's growth prospects.

Furthermore, the Budget has fully exempted cobalt powder and waste, scrap of lithium-ion battery, Lead, Zinc, and 12 more critical minerals from BCD. This move will make electric vehicles more affordable for consumers, as they are now less expensive to manufacture.

In the mobile phone battery manufacturing sector, 28 additional capital goods have been exempted, providing a boost to this segment's growth prospects. Overall, these measures will contribute significantly to India's efforts towards a cleaner and more sustainable future. The exponential growth of the EV industry in India is expected to continue with these policy interventions, benefiting both consumers and manufacturers alike.
