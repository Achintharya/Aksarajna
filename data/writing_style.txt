The Budget 2025-26 marks a major milestone in India's transition to electric vehicles (EVs). In order to boost battery production and support domestic manufacturing, the government has exempted additional capital goods for EV and mobile phone battery manufacturing. This move is expected to make EVs more affordable and align with the government's goal of achieving 30 per cent of automobile sales as EVs by 2030.

In July 2024, the Budget had exempted 25 critical minerals that were not domestically available. The Budget 2025-26 further exempts cobalt powder and waste, scrap of lithium-ion battery, Lead, Zinc and 12 more critical minerals to support domestic manufacturing and value addition. The exemption of 35 additional capital goods for EV battery manufacturing and 28 additional capital goods for mobile phone battery manufacturing is expected to create a conducive environment for the growth of these industries in India. This, in turn, will contribute to the country's goal of achieving energy independence and reducing its carbon footprint.
