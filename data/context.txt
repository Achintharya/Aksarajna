The Indus Script is an ancient writing system used by the Indus Valley Civilization, which flourished around 2600-1900 BCE. The script remains undeciphered, and its exact nature and purpose are subjects of ongoing research.

The script is composed of various artifacts, including seals, pottery, and copper tablets, characterized by its pictographic and logographic elements. It is known for unique symbols and remains undeciphered, making it one of the most enigmatic scripts in history.

Over 100 attempts at decipherment have been made since the 1920s, with the topic being popular among amateur researchers. In 2025, a $1 million prize was announced for deciphering the script.

Key points of agreement include:

* The right-to-left direction of inscriptions
* The numerical nature of certain signs
* The functional homogeneity of terminal signs

The Indus script's 'fish sign' has been interpreted as a homophone for 'star' using the rebus principle. Some scholars argue that the script recorded an early form of Dravidian languages.

 Characteristics of the Indus script:

* The characters are largely pictorial, depicting objects found in the ancient world generally, found locally in Harappan culture, or derived from the natural world.
* Many abstract signs have also been identified.
* Some signs are compounds of simpler pictographic signs, while others are not known to occur in isolation.
* Some signs resemble tally marks and are often interpreted as early numerals.

The script has a large number of principal signs, over 400, which is considered too large a number for each character to be a phonogram, and so the script is generally believed to be logo-syllabic.

Writing direction of the Indus script:

* The script is generally read from right to left, though some exceptions wherein the script is written left to right or in a boustrophedon mode are also known.
* In the case of seals, which create a mirror image impression on the clay or ceramic on which the seal is affixed, the impression of the seal is read from right to left.

relationship to other scripts:

* Researchers have compared the Indus Valley script to the Brahmi and Tamil-Brahmi scripts, suggesting that there may be similarities between them.
* The Indus Valley script may have had a relation to a Dravidian language, as suggested by linguists such as Iravatham Mahadevan, Kamil Zvelebil, and Asko Parpola.

The Indus script has primarily been found on stamp seals, pottery, bronze, and copper plates, tools, and weapons. The script might have been developed between 3500 BC and 2700 BC.

Inscriptions are very short, typically around 5 signs, with the longest inscription being 34 characters long. There are doubts whether the Indus script records a written language or is instead a system of non-linguistic signs or proto-writing, similar to merchant's marks and house marks.

Researchers have identified about 400 signs of the Indus script, with 31 signs repeated over 100 times. Some researchers suggest that the 400 signs can be made of 39 elementary signs, with the rest being variations.

Trade connections between the Indus Valley Civilization and the Mesopotamia region have been suggested, as evidenced by the presence of clay tablets with the Indus script in the Mesopotamia region.

Despite extensive research, the script remains undeciphered due to the lack of bilingual texts and the perishable nature of the materials on which it was written.
